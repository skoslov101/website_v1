## Hey!
Thanks for stopping by. I'll be trying to add interesting content to this page as I find it or create it!

### New publications from Foster Lab members!
Yvonne Chen, Liz Siefert, and I all had separate papers accepted and published in JNeuro within the span of a few weeks! Congrats to Liz and Yvonne on having their awesome work get published.

[Liz's work](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/24/e0022242024) looks at the impact of targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during sleep on different facets of item-memory/learning. In short, they found that their TMR paradigm improved memory for unique features while shared item features were rememberd less well. Also congrats to Liz on being featured as one of [JNeuro's featured articles of the issue!](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/24/etwij44242024)

[Yvonne's exciting work](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/22/e2180232024) takes a look at face representation in the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) during encoding and retrieval. In brief, they carefully delineate VTC face-selective regions within participants to demonstrate activity within these patches during both encoding and retrieval. Interesting, they don't find evidence for an anterior-shift during retrieval. Also very interesting to see the individual differences in the orientation/organization of VTC face-selective regions!

And lastly, I'll post my new pub on the main page, but here's the link to our work taking advantage of the Natural Scenes Dataset [absolutely incredible resource openly available here](https://naturalscenesdataset.org/) looking at differences in activity between subregions of medial parietal cortex during an extensive item-recognition task. And a big thanks to JNeuro for selecting this manuscript to be one of the [featured articles of the week!](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/18/etwij44182024). Article itself can be found [here](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/18/e2220232024).

### Preprint alert!  
Check out [this awesome preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.17.342881v1) from the lab's Yvonne Chen on better identification of ripple activity in the hippocampus! 

### See what I've been working on with the LewPea Lab!    
We used eye-tracking to characterize the nature of monitoring during prospective remembering across different levels of ongoing demands. We made a brief summary of the work for VSS 2020. [Check it out here](https://youtu.be/bvSOIiwkwR4). Let me know what you think!
