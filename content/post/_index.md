## Hey!
Thanks for stopping by. I'll be trying to add interesting content to this page as I find it or create it!

### Preprint alert!  
Check out [this awesome preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.17.342881v1) from the lab's Yvonne Chen on better identification of ripple activity in the hippocampus! 

### See what I've been working on with the LewPea Lab!    
We used eye-tracking to characterize the nature of monitoring during prospective remembering across different levels of ongoing demands. We made a brief summary of the work for VSS 2020. [Check it out here](https://youtu.be/bvSOIiwkwR4). Let me know what you think!
