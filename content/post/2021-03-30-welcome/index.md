# Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by my website. I hope to begin curating content that I think would be useful for other researchers here. I may even generate some myself as time goes by. Just to generate some sample content (mostly for myself), here's some things that I'm excited about this week!

1) The massive 7T dataset outlined in [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432340v1). 
> Thanks to the group who undertook this herculean effort and are going to make the data available upon publication! In short, they collected 32-40 fMRI sessions from 8 participants while they performed a memory task. They also collected every other measurement under the sun. I can't wait to take a look at this!


2) Lorenc & Sreenivasan's [commentary on distributed systems for working memory](https://doi.org/10.1080/13506285.2021.1899091).
> **Abstract:**  
> In her recent Opinion, Xu argues that visual cortex is non-essential for visual working memory (WM) storage. In our response, we highlight some inconsistencies that undermine Xu’s claims and strengthen the notion that visual regions play a critical role in visual WM. Moreover, we contend that this framing of the debate ignores the larger point that WM storage is unlikely to be the purview of any single brain region. We outline a perspective that we term the “distributed systems view,” which considers WM – and storage in particular – to be distributed across multiple brain regions. This view is bolstered by evidence that a wide array of regions throughout the brain are involved in WM. Viewed in this light, the focus shifts from asking which regions are essential for WM and towards questions about how representations stored within each region complement one another, how they interact, and how they contribute to behaviour

3) And of course - building a website using R, blogdown, and markdown/macdown! 
> A big big thanks to the team behind the intro to making a website with [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I believe it's Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill. I used that outline to begin working on this website a while ago, but finally got back to it this week to make it public-facing. I have a long way to go, but still feels good to have this started!
