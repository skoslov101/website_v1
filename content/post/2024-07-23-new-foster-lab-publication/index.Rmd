### New paper out in _Cell Reports_ by Yvonne Chen et al.!

In this manuscript, Yvonne Chen and colleagues characterize hippocampal ripples across a number of cognitive states (rest, sleep, task...).  Really cool work looking at 'what' the spectral features of true-ripples may be, how to identify them, and how they may or may not vary across states. Check it out [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109304)!
