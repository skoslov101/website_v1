<h3>New paper out in <em>Cell Reports</em> by Yvonne Chen et al.!</h3>
<p>In this manuscript, Yvonne Chen and colleagues characterize hippocampal ripples across a number of cognitive states (rest, sleep, task…). Really cool work looking at ‘what’ the spectral features of true-ripples may be, how to identify them, and how they may or may not vary across states. Check it out <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109304">here</a>!</p>
