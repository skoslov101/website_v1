abstract: Human neuroimaging studies of episodic memory retrieval routinely observe the engagement of specific cortical regions beyond the medial temporal lobe. Of these, medial parietal cortex (MPC) is of particular interest given its distinct functional characteristics during different retrieval tasks. Specifically, while recognition and autobiographical recall tasks are both used to probe episodic retrieval, these paradigms consistently drive distinct spatial patterns of response within MPC. However, other studies have emphasized alternate MPC functional dissociations in terms of brain network connectivity profiles or stimulus category selectivity. As the unique contributions of MPC to episodic memory remain unclear, adjudicating between these different accounts can provide better consensus regarding MPC function. Therefore, we used a precision-neuroimaging dataset (7T functional magnetic resonance imaging) to examine how MPC regions are differentially engaged during recognition memory and how these task-related dissociations may also reflect distinct connectivity and stimulus category functional profiles. We observed interleaved, though spatially distinct, subregions of MPC where responses were sensitive to either recognition decisions or the semantic representation of stimuli. In addition, this dissociation was further accentuated by functional subregions displaying distinct profiles of connectivity with the hippocampus during task and rest. Finally, we show that recent observations of dissociable person and place selectivity within the MPC reflect category-specific responses from within identified semantic regions that are sensitive to mnemonic demands. Together, by examining precision functional mapping within individuals, these data suggest that previously distinct observations of functional dissociation within MPC conform to a common principle of organization throughout hippocampalâ€“neocortical memory systems.

summary: The medial parietal cortex (MPC) is ubiquitously implicated in studies of human episodic memory retrieval. Interestingly, distinct subregions of MPC are engaged depending on the type of retrieval task being performed. Other types of functional dissociation have also been reported for MPC, focusing on brain network organization or stimulus selectivity. To reconcile these different functional views, we leveraged a precision-neuroimaging dataset where participants performed thousands of recognition memory trials. We observed distinct MPC subregions supporting either recognition decisions or their semantic content, which recapitulated distinct patterns of hippocampal connectivity and visual category selectivity within MPC. These findings promote a common principle of functional organization that is shared among brain regions supporting episodic memory and advances our understanding of MPC.
