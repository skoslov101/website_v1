bio: I research memory and decision making. When I'm not doing that, I'm playing soccer, drinking beer, watching theatre, or trying to figure out how to combine the three.

I'm in my third year as a [BRAIN Initiatve](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) F32 Postdoctoral Researcher in [Brett Foster's lab](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brett-Foster) at [The University of Pennsylvania](https://www.med.upenn.edu/). My current research is focused on the intersection of decision making and memory processes, with a primary focus on the oft neglected Posterior Cingulate Cortex. I hope to use neuroimaging and intracranial electrophysiology to better understand how the subregions of the PCC are implicated in decision making and memory.

I completed my PhD in [Jarrod Lewis-Peacock's lab](https://www.lewpealab.org/) at the University of Texas at Austin. There, I used neuroimaging, novel behavioral paradigms, and eye-tracking to investigate prospective memory (or how we 'remember to remember'). I'm always interested in the dynamic intersection of memory and decision making processes, and how our ability to engage both can lead to real-world memory outcomes. Maybe one day, I'll be able remember where I set down the car keys. Or to make sure I grab a mask on my way our of the door.

I love mentoring students and researchers, so if there's anything written above that sounds interesting to you please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm happy to talk about research, graduate school and fellowship applications, or anything else that may be helpful to those learning how to navigate academia!
