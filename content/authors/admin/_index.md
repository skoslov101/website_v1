Seth Koslov is  a 5th year Phd candidate in the Lewis-Peacock memory research lab at the University of Texas at Austin. His research interests are in all things memory: how do we remember, when do we remember, and why do we forget. These questions all involve investigating the intersection between cognitive control, attention, and memory systems. He uses fMRI, computational modeling, and behavioral techniques.
