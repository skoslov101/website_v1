I'm in my first year as a Postdoctoral Associate in [Brett Foster's lab](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brett-Foster) at [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/). My current research is focused on the intersection of decision making and memory processes in oft neglected the Posterior Cingulate Cortex. I hope to use neuroimaging and ecog to better understand how the subregions of the PCC are implicated in decision making and memory.

I completed my PhD in [Jarrod Lewis-Peacock's lab](https://www.lewpealab.org/) at the University of Texas at Austin. There, I primarly used neuroimaging, novel behavioral paradigms, and eye-tracking to investigate prospective memory (or how we 'remember to remember'). I'm always interested in the dynamic intersection of memory and decision making processes, and how our ability to engage both can lead to real-world memory outcomes. Maybe one day, I'll be able remember where I set down the car keys. Or to make sure I grab a mask on my way our of the door.
